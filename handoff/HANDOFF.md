## 2025-08-22 10:35 UTC – Init (codex-cli)
- Context: Rubi builder live; adding import/persist/generate. Establishing multi-agent handoff for this repo.
- Current state:
  - `/rubi` works; Playwright baseline tests pass.
  - handoff/ folder and CODEOWNERS will coordinate with project-overseer.
- Open tasks:
  1. T1 Import validation + helpful errors – codex-cli
  2. T2 Generate Code v2 – codex-cli
  3. T6 Handoff sync – codex-cli
- Constraints: Node 18, Playwright installed.
- Next steps:
  - Add validation/error UI for Import (AC in T1) and tests.
  - Add per-feature stub generation (AC in T2) and tests.
  - Wire `handoff:sync` to mirror with `~/agent-coordination/`.
- Links: e2e tests in `e2e/rubi-*.spec.ts`
